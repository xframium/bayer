With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about our security measures.</text>
	    	
	    	<text type="contains">You can use many features of our Website without disclosing your personal data.

	    	<text type="contains">We will retain control of and responsibility for the use of any personal data you disclose to us. Some of this data may be stored or processed at computers located in other jurisdictions whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live. In such cases, we will ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the data that are equivalent to those that apply in the country in which you live.</text>
	    	
	    	<text type="contains">The personal data we collect will only be used for the purpose of supplying you with the requested products or services or for other purposes for which you have given your consent, except where otherwise provided by law.</text>
