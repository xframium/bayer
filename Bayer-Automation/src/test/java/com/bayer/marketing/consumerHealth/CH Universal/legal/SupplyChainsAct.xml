            <text type="contains">The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. The following highlights Bayer’s global efforts in this regard.</text>
        	<text type="contains">Bayer supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a number of globally recognized declarations for multinational enterprises. As a founding member of the</text>

        	<text type="contains">It is in effect at all Bayer locations, and it applies to Bayer’s business operations worldwide. Bayer will use this position as a framework to guide our decision-making and constructive engagement within our sphere of influence, while the responsibility of the governments of the various countries for protection of human rights is respected.</text>
        	<text type="contains">This code of conduct comprises the areas of ethics, labor, health, safety, environment, and quality as well as related management systems. Our Supplier Code of Conduct emphasizes international labor and human rights standards such as the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) eight core labor standards. Suppliers are expected to protect the human rights of their employees and to treat them with dignity and respect. Supplier employees shall have the right to freely choose employment, the right to associate freely and join or be represented by worker councils or labor unions on a voluntary basis, and the right to bargain collectively as they choose. Workers also have the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination.</text>
        	<text type="contains">In order to successfully address the diverse challenges of a sustainable supply chain and to leverage synergies together with other companies, we collaborate with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) as well as with Together for Sustainability (TfS), an initiative co-founded by Bayer. In both initiatives, we focus on the standardization of sustainability aspects in the relevant industries in order to establish corresponding social, ethical and environmental practices among our suppliers. The exchange of supplier assessments and audits among member companies enables access to additional sustainability evaluations of suppliers who also work for Bayer. This minimizes the administrative burden for both suppliers and the member companies.</text>

This includes improved conditions for workers (including freely chosen employment, no involuntary prison labor, abolition of child labor, and no use of forced, bonded or indentured labor), economic development, and a cleaner environment for local communities.</text>
        	<text type="contains">is a group of multinational companies which aims at developing and implementing a global supplier engagement program that assesses and improves sustainability sourcing practices, including ecological and social aspects. The initiative is based on good practices and builds on established principles – such as the</text>

We follow a clear ‘zero tolerance to child labor’ policy in our business operations worldwide. We do not tolerate child labor in our supply chain either, where we take action against known cases of violations.</text>

            <text type="contains">Bayer regards adherence to sustainability standards within the supply chain as a crucial factor in the value chain. By acting responsibly in collaboration with our suppliers, we aim to minimize risks and create stable, long-term business relationships with our partners. For this reason, Bayer applies not just economic standards, but also environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards in choosing new suppliers or continuing its relationships with existing ones. These standards are defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes child labor avoidance and no utilization of forced, bonded or indentured labor or involuntary prison labor. It is binding and integrated into electronic ordering systems and standard contracts throughout Bayer. The Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact and our Human Rights Position</text>
        	<text type="contains">The sustainability performance of our suppliers is monitored through online supplier assessments and on-site audits. Suppliers are selected for these evaluations based on a combination of country and material risks as well as strategic importance in accordance with our</text>
        	<text type="contains">We offer training activities to help procurement staff worldwide create awareness of sustainability and possible risks in dialogue with our suppliers. Training for procurement employees includes online courses dealing with the EcoVadis sustainability assessment process. In addition, we organize specific training events, such as courses for selected procurement employees on the issue of sustainability audits, and provide online trainings and information material.</text>
        	<text type="contains">We regularly provide information on sustainability to our suppliers through Supplier Days. This global and local dialogue is essential to build up reliable relations and to make the principles of our procurement policy and our sustainability requirements clear to our suppliers. In return, we would like to know more about the suppliers’ situation in order to be able to identify and remove obstacles in our collaboration at an early stage. The continuous development of suppliers in terms of sustainability is also a key objective of the industry initiatives TfS and PSCI. The TfS initiative offers an online Supplier Academy providing trainings on the initiative, Sustainability in Supply Chains and the Sustainability assessment and audit process. Moreover, the TfS member companies organize joint supplier events with the aim to promote a mutual understanding on sustainability challenges and requirements in the supply chain. PSCI likewise promotes continuing supplier development by means of the comprehensive information provided on the PSCI website</text>
